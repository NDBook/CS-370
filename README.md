Current/Emerging Trends in Computer Science


Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given?  What code did you create yourself?

This project is the treasure hunt game where an player needs to find the treasure before the pirate agent does.  I was provided two python classes and a jupyter notebook
to assist me with the project.  The first class, TreasureMaze.py, represents the environment, which includes a maze object defined as a matrix.  The second class, 
GameExperience.py, stores the episodes, which are all the states that come in between the initial state and the terminal state.  My contribution to this project was 
to write the part of the game that represents the intelligent agent, which is the pirate.  

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

There are many fields in which a computer scientist can apply their knowledge, but using computer science principles to solve problems and develop technology is a 
summation of their purpose.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

First we begin to understand the problem and attempt to break it down into smaller manageable parts, develop a solution typically with an algorithm, implement the code/solution,
and test it for functionality. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

To evaluate whether or not this new technology should be developed.  If the newly developed technology could be used for malicioius purposes, it is the responsibility of the
developer to decide if this technology should even be pursued.  Yes, if I don't do it, someone else will, so maybe being apart of it's creation can help keep it within 
ethical boundries.
